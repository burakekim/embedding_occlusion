# Project Title

This is the code for the paper "Deep Occlusion Framework for Multimodal Earth
Observation Data", which is currently under revision.

We propose a framework that enables input feature attribution by uncovering the influence of input features through systematic occlusion in the embedding space, shedding light on how each modality contributes to the deep learning model's predictions in Earth Observation data analysis.
