# Enabling Embedding-level Input Feature Attribution with Occlusion

This is the code for the paper "Deep Occlusion Framework for Multimodal Earth Observation Data", which is currently under revision.

We propose a framework that enables input feature attribution by uncovering the influence of input features through systematic occlusion in the embedding space. This framework reveals how each modality contributes to the deep learning model's predictions in Earth Observation data analysis.
